	Once there was a small village. Ram was a small boy living in that village. He was very nice and
smart but shy.He had a friend named Rana. Rana lived right next to Ram's house. He was very brave but not so nice. 

	One day Ram and Rana were walking in a forest near the village. They saw a mango tree with many mangos. They decided to get 
some mangos because they were very hungry. However, they couldn't reach the mangos because the mangos were to high 
up. Ram got an idea to throw rocks at the mangos. That didn't work out great because Rana threw a stone and it hit 
someone far away. They heard yelling and footsteps coming towards them. Soon they saw the man who they hit, and he
was very angry.
